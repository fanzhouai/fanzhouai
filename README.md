## Fan Zhou 

I'm a Ph.D candidate in [CS dept.] at [Laval University], supervised by [Prof.Chiab-draa](https://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~chaib/) and [Prof. Boyu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/home?authuser=0).  My research areas includes transfer learning, domain adaptation and multi-task learning. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I was working on vehicle engineering especially on electrical vehicles control supervised by [Prof.Shichuang Yang](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/09007/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Bin Xu](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/07312/zh_CN/index.htm) in [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/).
