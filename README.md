### About me

I'm a Ph.D candidate in CS dept. at Laval University. supervised by Prof.Chiab-draa and Prof. Boyu Wang.  My research areas includes transfer learning, domain adaptation and multi-task learning. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I was working on vehicle engineering especially on electrical vehicles control supervised by Prof.Shichuang Yang and Prof. Bin Xu in Beihang University.
